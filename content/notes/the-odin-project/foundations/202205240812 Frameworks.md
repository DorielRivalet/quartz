# Frameworks
Express is a JavaScript framework

Vanilla JavaScript is referring to programming in JavaScript without the use of any framework.

Analogy: programming languages are like hammers and wrenches, the brand of those tools are the frameworks. If you don't know how to use a hammer then it also means knowing what brand it is isn't of much help either, so first you need to learn how to use a hammer in general.

Imagine you make lots of websites and you notice that the way you make most of those websites follow a specific programming pattern (framework) or repeat a certain group of functions (library). You could then, design or adopt a framework/library that speeds up the development process of making such websites.

Essentially, frameworks add another level of abstraction. But if you don't understand the level of abstraction that's below it, then it makes it harder to know what/how to do certain things when problems arise, such as caused by a lack of optimization.

I assume NoCode is the highest level of abstraction at the moment?

Bootstrap is a helpful framework for managing HTML and CSS.

Node.js, a JavaScript runtime, is also used for backend programming.

Scaffolding

-   MySQL (relational)
-   PostgreSQL (relational)
-   MongoDB (non-relational, document)

test-driven development approach, which implies that testing goes first and coding comes after.

{{ variable_name }}
{% expression %}

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>

 {% if youngest_teams %}
    <ul>
    {% for team in youngest_teams %}
        <li>{{ team.team_name }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% else %}
    <p>No teams are available.</p>
{% endif %}

</body>
</html>
```
