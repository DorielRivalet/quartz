# Analogy
- Your room is a web page
- The objects in your room are HTML elements (represented by DOM Nodes)
- The colors, size, etc. of those objects is CSS.
- You are JavaScript (and do DOM Manipulation to interact with the objects in your room)
- The other rooms in your house are other web pages
- Your house is a website
- The address of your house is the IP Address
- Web developers are construction workers
- Earthquakes are outages
- The sign at the entrance of your house is the README
