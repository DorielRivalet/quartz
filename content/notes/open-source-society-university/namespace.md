# Content
An analogy for namespace can be the following:

Imagine a house with 2 rooms, lets call room A ```std``` and room B ``ourCustomNameSpace``

In both rooms there is an object with the same, ``Television``

in a program, if we access the TV using namespace std, we are talking about the TV in room A, but if use namespace ourCustomNameSpace and then access TV, we are talking about the TV in room B.

std::TV

ourCustomNameSpace::TV

TV: it defaults to the first namespace used.
