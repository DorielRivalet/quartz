# Content
bitfields can be 4 or 8 bytes and composed of many flags

those flags are numbers of powers of two

2 to the 0 is 1, this is the first flag

2 to the 1 is 2, this is the second flag

2 to the 2 is 4, this is the third flag.

a bitfield with flags 1 and 2 results in the number 3 for example.

a bitfields with flags 2 and 3 results in the number 6 for example, and if the first flag is also added it ends up at 7. the fourth flag is 8 because its 2 to the power of 3.
