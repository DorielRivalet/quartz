axioms

proofs

arrow notation, basically what comes after exponentiation

quaternions, what comes after complex numbers

sigma and pi notation

addition is translation, multiplication is rotation

euler angles

gimbal lock

multiplication loses its associativity

eg

j times k is not the same as k times j

if real numbers are one dimensional, then complex numbers are two dimensional

dimensionality: (x) -> (x,y)

the y part is where i is

hypperreal numbers, for number systems beyond quaternions, math gets a bit odd in here


question: what was the field of geometry that wasnt euclidean? where the shortest path between A and B wasn't a straight line. rather, it was a curve.
