But that does raise an interesting question. How many layers are there? Here's a (_very_) rough draft. I skip over a lot of complexity and options for simplicity - to make the point and to keep this reasonably readable. I may also have missed a layer or two (**edit** or more - see the replies for lots of great details!) - this is off the top of my head and it's been a long day. Still, enjoy, and maybe some other people can add on and round this out.\n\n-   At the bottom, it's electrons in a circuit.\n    \n-   The circuits are arranged into patterns that happen to execute very simple boolean logic if you watch the inputs and outputs at the right time.\n    \n-   Those simple boolean circuits are built into more complex, integrated circuits that happen to execute more complex mathematical operations - boolean algebra and addition, subtraction, etc.\n    \n-   Those integrated circuits are arranged into modules, grouping them together into useful processors and sub processors.\n    \n-   Those modules are arranged and connected together via a bus, with some inputs and outputs, long-term storage and a clock - now you've got the hardware of a computer!\n    \n\nNow things get interesting - we switch to software layers.\n\n-   This machine is basically a complex calculator. It does nothing unless you tell it to do something via a list of instructions - inputs to put in to various modules and what to do with the outputs.\n    \n-   These instructions are called the Machine Codes - they're particular to this specific machine - they correspond to the specific hardware after all.\n    \n-   They're very low level instructions - usually things like \"add 2 and 5\", etc.\n    \n\nSetting aside how those instructions get written for the moment -\n\n-   On boot-up one of the module has a set of instructions to run - they're basically hardwired (Flash ROM)\n    \n-   Among those instructions are various tests to see what is plugged in (modular hardware!) and if it's functioning properly.\n    \n-   One of the last things that boot ROM does is look for another program to launch - the Operating System.\n    \n-   The OS takes over and starts running things.\n    \n-   The OS provides more complex instructions and a whole new set of abstractions - files, folders, ways to talk to all the hardware that is plugged in, ways to start other programs running, handle their termination, etc.\n    \n-   Those programs are the applications that we run on computers all the time - games, web browsers, email, all the services the OS runs in the background, etc.\n    \n-   Web browsers are particularly interesting - they provide yet another layer of abstraction.\n    \n-   More code can be retrieved from another computer and run within the web browser - HTML to display the page itself, and interpreted languages like Javascript, which make calls to instructions the Web Browser provides.\n    \n-   How the code is retrieved from another computer is also interesting - network communications go through a stack of abstractions all the way down to the hardware level. Check out [the TCP/IP stack](https://www.google.com/search?q=tcp+ip+stack\u0026oq=tcp+ip+stack\u0026aqs=chrome.0.57j0l3j62.2073j0\u0026sourceid=chrome\u0026ie=UTF-8) some time.\n    \n\nBacking up - how does that software get written?\n\n-   One could write the machine code directly - a series of 1's and 0's arranged in a file that the OS can load and run.\n    \n-   But that's wildly tedious and prone to error - there's a lot to do just to get the program to do anything useful and leave the computer in a state that can continue to process.\n    \n-   So people invented languages - first Assembly Language, which is a straight 1:1 mapping to something more human readable than the 1's and 0's.\n    \n-   Then more complex languages that directly express more complex operations than the machine code does - abstract constructs like functions and loops.\n    \n-   Assembly is converted into machine code by an Assembler - a program that does the task of substituting the machine codes for each of the assembly instructions.\n    \n-   More complex languages are compiled - converted from the more abstract language to a set of machine instructions.\n    \n-   Another option is interpreted languages, which are basically compiled at run time - each line converted as it's needed.\n    \n-   One more thing people can do is write Libraries of useful functions - a layer that wraps up the lower-level instructions into a new abstraction that provides a more useful, condensed set of alternate, more complex instructions.\n    \n-   These libraries are chunks of machine code that you can add to your program so you don't have to write them yourself. Open GL is one such library - it provides useful graphics abstractions that let you think in terms of polygons instead of moving numbers into screen memory space and the like.\n    \n\nSo, adding it all up, a program you write will pull in libraries, usually a layer or two of them. Those libraries and some of your code will call through to OS instructions. Those OS instructions are mapped to lower-level instructions (libraries within the OS - it's not a single layer... probably has more than a few layers of its own). Eventually it all gets boiled down into assembly/machine code. That code then runs in the hardware - within a module, on an integrated circuit. And \"runs\" means putting the specified 1's and 0's where they should be when they should be there. Those 1's and 0's are electrical switches - 1 for on, 0 for off. They're fed into the integrated circuits which are themselves composed of lots of lower-level boolean logic gates. Those logic gates are composed of simple transistors.\n\nAll together, call it ... maybe 4 layers before you hit the OS, then another... say 3? 4? 5? before you hit machine code. Then it's modules, integrated chips, logic gates and transistors. Another 4 layers of abstraction. Toss in a couple more for good measure (I'm sure there are some additional physical abstraction layers in there - EEPROMS, and the like), my back-of-the-envelope math puts us in the ballpark of 15... maybe 20 layers from your compiled software to the transistors. Depending on what you're doing, of course.\n\n\n# Sources\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gbe4j/comment/caimx99/?utm_source=share\u0026utm_medium=web2x\u0026context=3","lastmodified":"2022-06-02T16:26:24.920130109Z","tags":null},"/notes/open-source-society-university/bytes":{"title":"bytes","content":"\n\n# Unit of digital information\n0 or 1, 1bit\n\n00 01 10 11 2 bits\n\n...\n\n11111111 8 bits (1 byte)\n\nKiloBytes\n\nMegaBytes\n\nGigaBytes\n\nTeraBytes\n\nPettaBytes\n\nExaBytes\n\nZettaBytes\n\nYottaBytes\n\n```\n0 0\n01 1\n10 2\n11 3\n100 4\n1000 8\n10000 16\n100000 32\n1000000 64\n10000000 128\n11111111 255\n```\n\npower of two\n\noverflow = infinite of x resource in games = negative number\n\n```\n11111111 255 FF\n-1\n```\n\n7F half, nibble\n\nunsigned example 0 to 255\n\nsigned example -127 to 128\n\nword, double word, quad word\n\n2 bytes, 4 bytes, 8 bytes\n\nwhen dealing with multiple bytes: know the endianness\nbig endian and little endian\n\nbig endian: first bytes are the most significant\nlittle endian: last bytes are the most significant\n\n7f is 127 which is 011111111\n\n80 is 128 and notice how that is 100000000\n\nf is last digit in hex so the 7 becomes 8 and f goes back to 0\n\nSince FF is 1 byte which is 8 bits\n\nA bit is 0 or 1 so 8 bits goes from 00000001 to 11111111\n\nUnsigned and signed mean how the first digit is used\n\nIf the first digit is 1 then negative number\n\nIf the first digit is 0 then positive number\n\n\nthe first 4 bytes of any file is the file signature\n\nthe file size of the file is specified somewhere in the first bytes too, but i forgot where","lastmodified":"2022-06-02T16:26:24.920130109Z","tags":null},"/notes/open-source-society-university/computer":{"title":"computer","content":"\n# Metadata\n2022-05-31 05:09  | computer | [Doriel Rivalet](https://github.com/DorielRivalet)| #computer-science #programming \n\n# Content\n### Fundamentals of a Computer\n\nA computer is a machine which has the ability to\n\n-   Read and write from a memory which can be addressed\n-   Perform comparisons on the state of the memory, and perform an operation as a result of that. These operations include rewriting memory.\n-   Start functions based on content written in the memory. We call such content \"programs + data\", and the act of writing them **programming**.\n\nA very notable example of this is the most basic concept of computing, a [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine \"wikipedia:Turing machine\"), where the machine will read from one infinite line of code and instruction set in order to complete a function.\n\n### Redstone\n\nRedstone computers work by mimicking the architecture of a real computer. The mechanics of redstone and the items derived from it allow for the player to construct some simple constructs known as \"gates\" that mirror the real life function of similar real-life electronics. By combining them in certain ways, one can make something more advanced, including the various parts of a computer.\n\nAs you may know from school, electrical charge moves from an area of high concentration, to an area of low concentration. For this reason, using a battery to form a circuit is what allows things like light bulbs in your house to work; the electrons flow out from the negative end, through the bulb, exciting the filament, which produces photons and heat, then continue toward the positive side of the battery. With redstone however, a circuit is not required, because the power simply flowing to the block it's activating is all that's required (and all that's really convenient due to the nature of the voxel-based game). By using it and things such as redstone torches, repeaters, and comparitors, it's possible to make things known as \"gates\". Gates take an input, which is True if there's power, and False if there isn't power, and give an output based on simple rules. For example, the simplest gates to make are known as the \"identity\" and \"negation\" gates, or the \"A\" and \"NOT\" gates. The A gate is simply the redstones that transfers the power, or the use of a repeater, which pumps out a full-power signal when a signal is input. The Not gate is achievable by running a signal onto the top of a block that has a redstone torch on the side. It outputs whatever the input is not, thus the name. More advanced gates use 2 or sometimes 3 inputs, such as the \"OR\" gate, which outputs a signal when either input is True, and the \"AND\" gate, which outputs a signal only when BOTH inputs are True.\n\nMore advanced gates such as NAND, which means NOT AND- a fancy way to say the opposite output an AND gate gives, and NOR, which means NOT OR, can allow for you to process the information you send more complexly, or even store the information. In fact, NAND latch based memory, also known as Flip-Flops, are used for data storage in SSDs.\n\nBy knowing how computer hardware works, and by knowing how one can build different kinds of redstone gates, one can figure out how to combine them in order to replicate the functions of a computer. If you're interested in trying for yourself, I'm sure you can look around for something instructing to build a simple processing device known as an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), which is basically the brain of a calculator. You would learn how to build something with the sole purpose of taking two sets of inputs, applying a specific function, and outputting a number based on it. After that, you could attempt to build a computer meant to carry out other tasks, such as word processing, or even simulating a game.\n\nAll in all, it's just a case of people who know how the parts of a computer work, and who know how to make redstone do what they want it to do. As a result, they are able to design computers out of blocks and dust and sticks. And it's really amazing.\n\n# Sources\nhttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Redstone_computers\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/2fj27w/comment/ck9qf4y/?utm_source=share\u0026utm_medium=web2x\u0026context=3\n\n# Content Lists\nIf you prefer browsing the contents of this site through a list instead of a graph, you can find content lists here too:\n\n- [All Notes](notes/)\n\n## Knowledge Index\n- [The Odin Project](notes/index-list/the-odin-project.md)\n- [Open Source Society University](notes/index-list/open-source-society-university.md)\n- [Full Stack Open](notes/index-list/fullstack-open.md)\n- [Miscellaneous](notes/index-list/miscellaneous.md)\n- [Quartz](notes/index-list/quartz.md)\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-02T16:26:24.920130109Z","tags":null},"/notes/open-source-society-university/overview":{"title":"overview","content":"\n\n# Metadata\n2022-05-27 04:42\n\nTitle: overview of math and programming\n\nAuthor: [Doriel Rivalet](https://github.com/DorielRivalet)\n\n# Content\n\n## Preface\n\nThis article will be updated occasionally, as my own understanding of math and programming improve over time.\n\n## Zero\n\nLet's start with nothing\n\nHow can we represent nothing?\n\nWell, you could use the symbol 0, from the arabic numerals.\n\nor when talking about sets, you have the empty set {}\n\nlemme grab a LaTeX cheatsheet since i never wrote in math notation in markdown before\n\n$$0$$\n\n$${}$$\n\n```lua\nnil\n```\n\n```javascript\nnull\n```\n\n```python\nfalse\n```\n\nnow, how can we represent the opposite of nothing, i.e. something? \n\nthe inverse\n\n## One\n\n```\ntrue\n```\n\nwhich operator can we use to represent the opposite?\n\n$\\neg$\n\nso, we do:\n\n$\\neg$nothing\n\n$\\neg$0\n\n$\\neg$0 = 1\n\nhow is this done in [computers](notes/open-source-society-university/computer.md)? we can use logic gates\n\nthe input we have is 0, the output we want is 1, we can use the NOT logic gate\n\n![[notes/images/Pasted image 20220531190617.jpg]]\n\n$$A = 0$$\n$$\\overline A = 1$$\n\nso now we have the unary operator.\n\n$$-1 = -(1)$$\n$$-(-1) = 1$$\n```ruby\n#notGate.rb\na = false\na = not a\nputs a #true\n```\n\n```javascript\n//notGate.js\nlet a = false\nconsole.log(!a) //true\na = !a\nconsole.log(!a) //false\n```\n\n## Counting\n\nif we look at one of our hands, we should have 5 fingers. how do we know that we have 5? whats the action that we did to determine that value? counting.\n\n```python\n#counting.py\nfingersOnHand = 5\n\ndef countFingersOnHand:\n\treturn fingersOnHand\n\nprint(countFingersOnHand()) #returns 5\n```\n\n$$5 = 1+1+1+1+1$$\n\n[i could show why 1+1=2 but showing hundreds of pages for it is not needed for the general overview i'm aiming for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica)\n\nour hand is an array and we iterated through the elements of the array which in this case are our fingers. the act of counting is the iteration.\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \u0026 2 \u0026 3 \u0026 4 \u0026 5\\\\\nthumb \u0026 index \u0026 middle \u0026 ring \u0026 pinky\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nwhats the data type we are currently dealing with? integers\n\n10 is the action of doing addition by 1 and iterating 10 times that same operation\n\nwe can do 1+10, 1+11, etc.\n\nwe have addition, whats the inverse of it? subtraction\n\nif we do 1-2 then we get -1, a negative integer\n\nbut how is this represented in computers?\n\n## Binary Number\n\nwell, lets start over again\n\nwe have nothing, we can represent it by 0\n\nand we have something, we can represent it by 1\n\nlets call counting with only these two symbols binary counting\n\nbut why is it called binary? well, bi means two. -nary because of the numerical system\n\n0, then 1, then 10\n\nbut why is it going from 1 to 10? because we can only use two symbols\n\nsuppose we use 3 symbols instead: 0, 1 and 2\n\nu would count like this:\n\n0, then 1, then 2, then 10, then 11, then 12, then 20, then 21, and so on\n\ndo u see the pattern?\n\nbut, we use binary for efficiency purposes.

The integer n is called the [exponent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponent \"Exponent\") and the real number m is called the [significand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significand \"Significand\")or mantissa_.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation#cite_note-Calio2017-1) The term \"mantissa\" can be ambiguous where logarithms are involved, because it is also the traditional name of the [fractional part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_part \"Fractional part\") of the [common logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_logarithm \"Common logarithm\"). If the number is negative then a minus sign precedes m, as in ordinary decimal notation. In [normalized notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation#Normalized_notation), the exponent is chosen so that the [absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value \"Absolute value\") (modulus) of the significand m is at least 1 but less than 10.\n \n so for example, the number 1024, which in binary is ```10000000000```, which in hexadecimal is ```0x400```, which can be a uint16 or int16 datatype, which is $$2^{10}$$; can also be expressed as $$1.024*10^3$$.\n \n but some may ask: we have + for addition, \\* for multiplication and ^ for exponentiation, aren't we missing a symbol (*i.e*, + and \\* and ^) and the action it would represent (*i.e*, addition, multiplication and exponentiation) ?\n\n## Iterated Exponentiation\n\n enter arrow notation:\n \n$$2\\uparrow4 = 2^4 = 16$$\n\none arrow is exponentiation (iterated multiplication), two arrows is tetration (iterated exponentiation)\n\n$$2\\uparrow\\uparrow4 = 2^{2^{2^{2}}} = 2^{16} = 65536 = 0x10000 = 0b10000000000000000$$\n\ntetration: (tetra comes from four, the same way penta comes from five). now we found a pattern: hexa means six, that means hexation would be whats after pentation, and so on. but lets just stick with explaining tetration for now.\n\nlets use nested ```for``` loops in a program to write nested exponentiation (also called a tower of powers).\n\n```javascript\nfunction multipleExponentiation(num, arrows, num2){\n  let accumulator = num;\n\tfor (let i = 0;i \u003c= arrows;i++){\n\t\tfor (let j = 0;j \u003c= num2;j++){\n\t\t\taccumulator *=  num;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn accumulator;\n}\n\nconsole.log(multipleExponentiation(2,2,4))\n```\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-5 \u0026 -4 \u0026 -3 \u0026 -2 \u0026 -1 \u0026 0 \u0026 1 \u0026 2 \u0026 3 \u0026 4 \u0026 5\\\\\npentaLogarithm||pentaRoot \u0026 superRoot||superLogarithm \u0026 logarithm||root \u0026 division \u0026 subtract \u0026 succesor \u0026 addition \u0026 multiplication \u0026 exponentiation \u0026 tetration \u0026 pentation\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nSuccessor is doing a+1, addition is doing a+b\n\nDown arrow notation can be used to denote a logarithmic-type inverse of the up-arrow notation\n\n## Space === Time?\n\nthe act of running the above program is an event. an event can have two properties: the time that it happened and the space it happened at.\n\n```javascript\nconst program = document.querySelector(\".programResult\")\n\nfunction printProperties(){\n\tconsole.log(`time: ${this.time}, space: ${this.space}`)\n}\n\nprogram.addEventListener(\"computed\",printProperties)\n```\n\n\n```lua\n--birthdayEvent.lua\nlocal birthdayEvent = {}\nbirthdayEvent.position = [1.35,453,36.5]\nbirthdayEvent.time = \"03:46:50.103\"\n\nprint(\"result: \"..birthdayEvent.position[0]..\",\"..birthdayEvent.position[1]...\",\"...birthdayEvent.position[2]..\" \"..birthdayEvent[\"time\"]) -- result: 1.35,453,36.5 03:46:50.103\n```\n\nif we want to know for how long this program is going to run, meaning the time complexity of the algorithm, we can use big O notation.\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0;i \u003c= arrows;i++){ //O(N)\n\tfor (let j = 0;j \u003c= num2;j++){ // O(N)\n\t\taccumulator *=  num;\n\t}\n}\n//N*N = N^2\n```\n\n\n$$O(n^2)$$\n\nif instead of having a variable number, ```i \u003c= arrows``` ,we had a constant number, ```i \u003c= 10000000000000```, the time complexity would be\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0;i \u003c= 10000000000000;i++){ //O(1) because 10000000000000 is a constant\n\tfor (let j = 0;j \u003c= num2;j++){ // O(N) because num2 is variable\n\t\taccumulator *=  num;\n\t}\n}\n//N*1 = N\n```\n\n$$O(N)$$\nwe use the dominant term and discard the coefficients, why? because for example, the square of 64 is 4096. If you add that number to 2⁶⁴, it will be lost outside the significant digits.\n\nthe highest order\n\nwe can write down the time complexity... how can we determine the space complexity?\n\nThe space complexity is related to how much memory the program will use. In other words, the **total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program including the space of input values for execution**.\n\nlets see what are our inputs:\n```javascript\nmultipleExponentiation(2,2,4)\nconsole.log(typeof(2)) //number\n```\n\nso we put 3 arguments into the multipleExponentiation function, those 3 arguments are the same data type: number.\n\nif we go to the [JavaScript docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures)(the programming language's documentation), we see that the *number* data type occupies 8 bytes (64 bits).\n\n```javascript\nfunction multipleExponentiation(num, arrows, num2){ //8 bytes*3=24 bytes\n  let accumulator = num; //24+8=32 bytes\n\tfor (let i = 0;i \u003c= arrows;i++){ //32+8 = 40 bytes\n\t\tfor (let j = 0;j \u003c= num2;j++){ //40+8 = 48 bytes\n\t\t\taccumulator *=  num; //accumulator is already defined\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn accumulator; //accumulator is already defined\n}\n\n// 48 = constant = 1\n```\n\nAnd thus the space complexity of the function is\n\n$$O(1)$$\n\n## A Different Dimension\n\nlet's answer the second question: what if the number is negative in the square root?\n\n$$\\sqrt[2]{-2}$$\n\nwe can't multiply something times itself and get a negative number, see:\n\n2 times 2, 4. -2 times -2, 4.\n\nbut why is -2 times -2 equal to 4?\n\n\nlets review our current set of numbers:\n\n$${...-59999,-1,-0.653,0,1,2.71828,3.1415,...}$$\n\nif we multiply positive with positive, we go to the right of the number line\n\nif we multiply positive with negative, we go to the left of number line, because the negative changes direction.\n\nif we multiply negative with negative, you change direction twice, so you end up going as the same direction of multiplying two positive numbers.\n\nor explained in another way, multiplying by negative is a 180 degrees rotation, which is also 1pi radian\n\nif u do 180 twice u do a full rotation, and thus, go in the same direction. a 360degrees rotation, or 2pi radian\n\n$$1\\pi = 180\\degree$$\n\n$$2\\pi = 180\\degree*2 = 360\\degree$$\n\n\n\n![[notes/images/Pasted image 20220528204454.png]]\n\nso far our numbers can be drawn on a line that goes from right to left, or left to right, meaning that we are dealing with one dimensional numbers, and the rotations we do can only be by 180. what happens if we create a line thats orthogonal to our current line? meaning, a vertical line. we want a number system that goes right to left, left to right, but also... up or down!\n\n$$ourNumberSystem = \\{right-left,up-down\\}$$\n\nlets call the right-left part the x part, the real numbers. \n\nand the up-down part, the y part.\n\nnow we are dealing with two dimensional numbers!\n\nwhat happens if instead of wanting to do 180 rotations by changing the signs of a number, we want to do rotations of any degree, by changing the signs but also, the y part?\n\nwe are getting close, lets review our current problem:\n\n$$\\sqrt[2]{-1} = 1*x$$\n\nthat x has to be something in the up-down direction...\n\nwe need to do a 90 degree rotation.\n\n$$ourNeededNumber = \\{1,up-down\\}$$\n\nlet's define the unit in the up-down direction as i. and lets call it imaginary number.\n\n$$\\sqrt[2]{-1} = 1i$$\n\nand thus we created the complex plane\n\n![[notes/images/Pasted image 20220528211430.png]]\n\n\n$$i^2 = -1$$\n\nso, real numbers are one-dimensional, and the complex numbers are two-dimensional... what are three dimensional numbers? \n\nIn our C++ and JavaScript programs, we see that loops iterator variables go from i,j,k, and so on\n\nso we need a j unit? well...\n\nwe actually need 4 dimensional numbers.\n\nnotice how in positions of for example video-game objects, those are defined as \n\n```java\n//application.java\npublic class Application{\n\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args){\n\n\t\tstudent = new Student(\"Harry\", \"Gryffindor\");\n\t\tsword = new Sword(\"Godric Gryffindor's Sword\",{34,2560,64},\"Idle\");\n\t\that = new Hat(\"Sorting Hat\", {50,-300,140});\n\n\t\tif (student.house == \"Gryffindor\"){\n\t\t\n\t\t\tsword.position[0] = hat.position[0] + 0.03;\n\t\t\tsword.position[1] = hat.position[1] + 0;\n\t\t\tsword.position[2] = hat.position[2] - 0.05;\n\t\t\tsword::Materialize;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\n//student.java\npublic class Student{\n\n\tprivate String name;\n\tprivate String house;\n\n\tpublic Student(String swordName, String houseName){\n\t\tname = swordName;\n\t\thouse = houseName;\n\t}\n}\n\n//hat.java\npublic class Hat{\n\n\tprivate String name;\n\tprivate int[] position;\n\n\tpublic Hat(String hatName, int[] hatPosition){\n\t\tname = hatName;\n\t\tposition = hatPosition;\n\t}\n}\n\n//sword.java\npublic class Sword{\n\n\tprivate String name;\n\tprivate int[] position;\n\tprivate String state\n\n\tpublic Sword(String swordName, int[] swordPosition, String swordState){\n\t\tsword = swordName;\n\t\tposition = swordPosition;\n\t\tstate = swordState;\n\t}\n\n\tpublic void Materialize(){\n\t\tthis.state = \"Active\";\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs.)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n```java\nsword.position = new Vector3(x,y,z)\n```\n\nwhere position is our variable (which is a property of an instance of the Sword class, which we are accessing with the dot operator), assigned the value (```=```) of an instance(```new```) of a vector3 class(```Vector3```) with arguments x y z (*e.g*, ```10.4,50.3,40.5```)\n\nso, imagine x as i, y as j and z as... k!\n\n$$i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = i.j.k = -1$$\n\n4 dimensional numbers would be something called [quaternions](https://youtu.be/3BR8tK-LuB0?t=287) (quadra meaning four, the same way tetra means four, but from a different language origin, find out which one is greek and which one is latin!), and it introduces 2 more types of numbers: j and k. \n\n(notice how at the [6:20 mark](https://youtu.be/3BR8tK-LuB0?t=380) is related to the concept of [diffuse mode](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-motivation-and-mindset#the-learning-process))\n\nbut what if we want to [go even further beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TGalu36BHA) quaternions, the same way we went from exponentiation to then tetra/penta/hexa-tion with an arbitrary number of arrows?\n\nfortunately, we can use something called the Cayley-Dickson construction\n\nnow, dont be intimated by what that exactly means, just know that for now it allows us to create 2^N dimensional algebras. meaning that we can go from two-dimensional to 4-dimensional to 8-dimensional and so on.\n\noctonions (octo meaning eight) come after quaternions, and so on.\n\nthe further u go on these algebraic structures, the more odd things can get, see:\n\nPassing from the reals to the complex numbers, we lose order; going from the complexes to the quaternions, we lose commutativity of multiplication. If we keep going, we lose associativity of multiplication, in increasing degrees: the sedenions are even less associative than the octonions, etc.\n\ninteresting, isn't it?\n\n# Sources\n\nown notes\n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ruby-integer-times-function-with-example/\n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-nth-fibonacci-number/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format\n\nhttps://es.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Subscripts_and_superscripts\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetration\n\nhttps://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1784166/why-are-there-no-triernions-3-dimensional-analogue-of-complex-numbers-quate\n\nhttp://davidagler.com/teaching/logic/handouts/supplemental_material/MarkdownForSymbolicLogic.html\n\nhttps://911electronic.com/de/how-does-a-not-gate-work/\n\nhttps://www.freecodecamp.org/news/big-o-notation-why-it-matters-and-why-it-doesnt-1674cfa8a23c/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperoperation\n\nhttps://googology.fandom.com/wiki/Tetration#Super_root\n\nhttps://oeis.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_arrow_notation#Down-arrow_notation\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PdegmlQ-x0\n\nhttps://www.faceprep.in/data-structures/space-complexity/\n\nhttps://www.baeldung.com/cs/space-complexity\n\nhttps://www.math-linux.com/latex-26/faq/latex-faq/article/latex-piecewise-function\n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/time-complexity-and-space-complexity/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate","lastmodified":"2022-06-02T16:26:24.920130109Z","tags":null},"/notes/quartz/CJK-+-Latex-Support-%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95":{"title":"CJK + Latex Support (测试)","content":"\n## Chinese, Japanese, Korean Support\n几乎在我们意识到之前，我们已经离开了地面。\n\n우리가 그것을 알기도 전에 우리는 땅을 떠났습니다.\n\n私たちがそれを知るほぼ前に、私たちは地面を離れていました。\n\n## Latex\n\nBlock math works with two dollar signs `$$...$$`\n\n$$f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n    f\\hat(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\n    \\,d\\xi$$\n\t\nInline math also works with single dollar signs `$...$`.

There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1.

Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\n📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\n$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat!

Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/quartz/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Updating\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations? On Unix/Mac systems you can run the following command for a one-line update! This command will show you a log summary of all commits since you last updated, press `q` to acknowledge this. Then, it will show you each change in turn and press `y` to accept the patch or `n` to reject it. Usually you should press `y` for most of these unless it conflicts with existing changes you've made! \n\n```shell\nmake update\n\n# or, if you don't want the interactive parts and just want the update\nmake update-force\n```\n\nOr, manually checkout the changes yourself.\n\n\u003e ⚠️ **WARNING** ⚠️\n\u003e\n\u003e If you customized the files in `data/`, or anything inside `layouts/`, your customization may be overwritten!\n\u003e Make sure you have a copy of these changes if you don't want to lose them.\n\n\n```shell\n# add Quartz as a remote host\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:jackyzha0/quartz.git\n\n# index and fetch changes\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout -p upstream/hugo -- layouts .github Makefile assets/js assets/styles/base.scss assets/styles/darkmode.scss config.toml data \n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-02T16:26:24.920130109Z","tags":null},"/notes/quartz/showcase":{"title":"Showcase","content":"\nWant to see what Quartz can do?

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/quartz/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](notes/quartz/hosting.md) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/quartz/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/quartz/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/quartz/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/quartz/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/quartz/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/quartz/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/quartz/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect!

They use some software that tests your initial  knowledgfe and from them recommend you material to learn, very nice for gap-filling.\n\n```\n\nRemember: use ```defer``` in the HTML script tag to wait for everything to load.\n\n# Sources: \n- The Odin Project Discord Server\n- Own notes","lastmodified":"2022-06-02T16:26:24.920130109Z","tags":null},"/notes/the-odin-project/foundations/foundations-summary":{"title":"foundations summary","content":"\n- [[notes/the-odin-project/foundations/internet-infrastructure]]\n  - Client and server, packets.\n  - Web page -\u003e Website -\u003e Web Server\n  - IP Address -\u003e Router -\u003e ISP\n  - Domain Name Servers\n  - TCP and UDP\n- Virtual Machines\n- Programming in general\n  - [**Problem Solving (most important concept)**](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-problem-solving)\n    - Divide and conquer approach\n    - How to ask good questions\n    - Pseudocode\n  - Compiler\n    - Lexical analyzer\n      - Tokens and lexemes\n        - Reserved words, Operators, Identifiers, Constants, Separators\n        - Example:\n\n        ```lua\n              newvalue = oldvalue + rate * 60\n\n        --[[  Token             Lexeme\n              Identifier      newvalue\n              assignOperation        =\n              Identifier      oldvalue\n              addOperation           +\n              identifier          rate\n              mulOperation           *\n              number                 6\n        ]] \n        ```\n\n  - Literals\n  - Variables\n    - Declaration and assignment\n    - Data types\n      - Enumeration (enum)\n      - Primitive\n        - Boolean [(which is stored as 1 byte instead of 1 bit)](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/185104/why-is-a-boolean-value-stored-as-a-byte-inside-of-a-computer-when-it-only-requir)\n          - Falsy and truthy values\n        - Integer\n          - 2 [bytes](notes/open-source-society-university/bytes.md)\n            - short, int16\n            - unsigned short, uint16\n          - 4 bytes\n            - signed integer, int32\n            - unsigned integer, uint32\n            - float\n          - 8 bytes\n            - double\n        - Char and String\n          - String manipulation\n          - String concatenation `('a'+'b')`\n          - String interpolation`('${a} {b}')`\n          - Escaping `(/)`\n      - Composite\n        - Object `{}`\n        - Array `[]`\n  - Operators\n    - Logical\n      - `AND`(and, \u0026\u0026, ∧, ·, \u0026), `OR`(or, ∥, ||, ∨, +), `NOT`(not,¬, ~, !), `XOR`(exclusive or, ↮, ⊕, ⊻, ≢.

The initial stack frame is sometimes called the `main` method.

IRB is a Read-Eval-Print Loop, or REPL, a tool offered by many modern programming languages.\n \n `#equal?` checks whether both values are the exact same object in memory. This can be slightly confusing because of the way computers store some values for efficiency. Two variables pointing to the same number will usually return `true`.\n\n```ruby\na = 5\nb = 5\na.equal?(b) #=\u003e true\n```\n\nThis expression is true because of the way computers store integers in memory. Although two different variables are holding the number 5, they point to the same object in memory. However, consider the next code example:\n\n```ruby\na = \"hello\"\nb = \"hello\"\na.equal?(b) #=\u003e false\n```\n\nThis happens because computers can’t store strings in the same efficient way they store numbers. Although the values of the variables are the same, the computer has created two separate string objects in memory.\n\nIn addition to the above operators, Ruby has a special operator that is affectionately referred to as the **spaceship operator**. Unlike the other comparison operators, which all return `true` or `false`, the spaceship operator returns one of three numerical values.\n\n`\u003c=\u003e` (spaceship operator) returns the following:\n\n-   `-1` if the value on the left is less than the value on the right;\n-   `0` if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right; and\n-   `1` if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.\n\n```ruby\n5 \u003c=\u003e 10    #=\u003e -1\n10 \u003c=\u003e 10   #=\u003e 0\n10 \u003c=\u003e 5    #=\u003e 1\n```\n\n\n**short circuit evaluation** is used in ruby to make it more efficient\n\nYou should use an `unless` statement when you want to **not** do something if a condition is `true`, because it can make your code more readable than using `if !true`.\n\n **your code needs to be readable and understandable by other people**, especially in the development stage.

Hash literals are represented with curly braces `{ }`. A key-value pair is an association where a key is assigned a specific value. A hash consists of a key, usually represented by a symbol, that points to a value (denoted using a `=\u003e`) of any type of data. Let's make some hashes to get the feel of it.

When you type something in at the irb prompt you are creating an expression. An **expression** is anything that can be evaluated, and pretty much everything you write in Ruby is an expression. An expression in Ruby always returns something, even if that's an error message or `nil`.

Just hit `cursor up` and then enter to run it again.\n\noften `$` is used to indicate that this is a system shell prompt, while `\u003e` is used by IRB to indicate that this is an interactive Ruby shell.\n\nsnake_case: define or initialize a method, variable, or file\"\n\n In Ruby, constants are denoted with all uppercase letters.\n \n namespace: variables environment\n \n The libraries that the system publishes are called \"gems\".\n  \n  npm install\n  gem install\n  sudo apt install ruby\n  \n  puts is print\n  \n  ctrl d to close\n  \n  irb -r ./your_file.rb\n  \n  ```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade\n```\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install gcc make libssl-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev libsqlite3-dev\n```\n\n`rbenv`, which makes it easy to install and manage Ruby versions.\n\n\nrbenv global 3.0.3\n\nruby -v\n\n# Sources\nhttps://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/introduction\n\nhttp://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/your_tools.html\n\nhttps://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-installing-ruby\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-02T16:26:24.924130281Z","tags":null},"/notes/the-odin-project/ruby/ruby-loops":{"title":"ruby loops","content":"\n# Metadata\n2022-05-26 18:48\n\nloops\n\n# Content\n\n```ruby\ni = 0\nloop do\n  puts \"i is #{i}\"\n  i += 1\n  break if i == 10\nend\n```\n\n```lua\ni = 0\nwhile true do\n\tprint(\"i is \"..i)\n\ti = i + 1\n\tif i==10 break\n\tend\nend\n```\n\n```ruby\n5.times do |number|\n  puts \"Alternative fact number #{number}\"\nend\n```\n\nnext: to next iteration\nbreak: the current iteration\n\nRubyists\n\ndot operator\n\n By convention, we use the curly braces (`{}`) when everything can be contained in one line. We use the words `do` and `end` when we are performing multi-line operations.\n \n When this program starts running, the call stack initially has one item -- called a **stack frame** -- that represents the global (top-level) portion of the program. The initial stack frame is sometimes called the `main` method.
